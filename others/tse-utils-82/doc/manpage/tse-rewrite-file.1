.SH NAME
tse-rewrite-file \- force a file to be rewritten (reencrypted) in the lower filesystem

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtse-rewrite-file [file1] [file2] [file3] ...\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
This script takes one or more files/directories/symlinks as arguments, moves each of them to a temporary file, and then moves them back to the original name.  This causes the file to be rewritten (and reencrypted) in the lower filesystem.

This script may be combined with \fBfind\fP(1) and \fBxargs\fP(1) to rewrite an entire Tse mountpoint, unmount, and sync:

  find . -xdev -print0 | xargs -r -0 /usr/bin/tse-rewrite-file
  tse-umount-private
  sync

It is advised that this script is executed in runlevel 1 or 3, to avoid simultanteous writes and race conditions with targeted files.

\fBUSING THIS SCRIPT WHILE GNOME, KDE, OR OTHER APPLICATIONS ARE RUNNING MAY CAUSE DATA LOSS.\fP
