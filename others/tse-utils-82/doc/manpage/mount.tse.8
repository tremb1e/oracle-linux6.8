.SH NAME
mount.tse \- Tse mount helper.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmount \-t tse\fP [\fIlower\ directory\fP] [\fItse\ mount\ point\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmount.tse\fP is Tse mount helper. The mount utility will defer to the mount helper to perform various configuration tasks; use the -i option to bypass the mount helper if you would rather manually specify your mount options. To mount Tse, specify the lower directory (i.e., /root/crypt) for the encrypted files and the Tse mountpoint (i.e., /mnt/crypt) for the decrypted view of the files:

\fImount \-t tse /root/crypt /mnt/crypt\fP
