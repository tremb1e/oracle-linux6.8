.TP
.B \-u, \-\-username USER
User to setup, default is current user if omitted
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-loginpass LOGINPASS
System passphrase for USER, used to wrap MOUNTPASS, will interactively prompt if omitted
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-mountpass MOUNTPASS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtse-setup-private\fP is a program that sets up a private cryptographic mountpoint for a non-root user, who is a member of \fBtse\fP group.

Be sure to properly escape your parameters according to your shell's special character nuances, and also surround the parameters by double quotes, if necessary. Any of the parameters may be:

  1) exported as environment variables
  2) specified on the command line
  3) left empty and interactively prompted

\fBThe user SHOULD ABSOLUTELY RECORD THE MOUNT PASSPHRASE AND STORE IN A SAFE LOCATION.  If the mount passphase file is lost, or the mount passphrase is forgotten, THERE IS NO WAY TO RECOVER THE ENCRYPTED DATA.\fP

Using the values of USER, MOUNTPASS, and LOGINPASS, \fBtse-setup-private\fP will:
  - Create ~/.Private (permission 700)
  - Create ~/Private (permission 500)
  - Backup any existing wrapped passphrases
  - Use LOGINPASS to wrap and encrypt MOUNTPASS
  - Write to ~/.tse/wrapped-passphrase
  - Add the passphrase to the current keyring
  - Write the passphrase signature to ~/.tse/Private.sig
  - Test the cryptographic mount with a few reads and writes

The system administrator can add the pam_tse.so module to the PAM stack which will automatically use the login passphrase to unwrap the mount passphrase, add the passphrase to the user's kernel keyring, and automatically perform the mount. See \fPpam_tse\fP(8).

.SH FILES
\fI~/.tse/auto-mount\fP

\fI~/.Private\fP - underlying directory containing encrypted data

\fI~/Private\fP - mountpoint containing decrypted data (when mounted)

\fI~/.tse/Private.sig\fP - file containing signature of mountpoint passphrase

\fI~/.tse/Private.mnt\fP - file containing path of the private directory mountpoint

\fI~/.tse/wrapped-passphrase\fP - file containing the mount passphrase, wrapped with the login passphrase

\fI~/.tse/wrapping-independent\fP - this file exists if the wrapping passphrase is independent from login passphrase
