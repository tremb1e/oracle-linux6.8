.SH NAME
tsed \- user\-space Tse daemon.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtsed\fP is a userspace daemon that runs as the user performing file operations under the Tse mount point. It services public key requests from the Tse kernel module; these requests are sent via netlink on file open events. tsed only needs to be run when a mount is done with a public key module.

The daemon can be started simply by running \fItsed\fP. tsed will register itself with the kernel as the daemon that should service all Tse filesystem requests done under the context of the user who runs the daemon.
