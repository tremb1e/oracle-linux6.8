	  Encrypted filesystem that operates on the VFS layer.  See
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/tse.txt> to learn more about
	  Tse.  Userspace components are required and can be
	  obtained from <http://tse.sf.net>.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called tse.

config T_SE_MESSAGING
	bool "Enable notifications for userspace key wrap/unwrap"
	depends on T_SE
	help
	  Enables the /dev/tse entry for use by tsed. This allows
	  for userspace to wrap/unwrap file encryption keys by other
	  backends, like OpenSSL.
