	---help---
	  Support for the Xsigo Virtual Ethernet (XVE) protocol,
	  Allowing private connectivity between servers using
	  Fabric switched Traffic.

config INFINIBAND_XVE_CM
	bool "Xsigo Virtual Ethernet Connected Mode support"
	depends on INFINIBAND_XVE
	default n
	---help---
	  This option enables support for XVE connected mode.

	  WARNING: Enabling connected mode will trigger some packet
	  drops for multicast and UD mode traffic from this interface,
	  unless you limit mtu for these destinations to 2030.

config INFINIBAND_XVE_DEBUG
	bool "Xsigo Virtual Ethernet debugging" if EMBEDDED
	depends on INFINIBAND_XVE
	default n
	---help---
	  This option causes debugging code to be compiled into the
	  XVE driver.  The output can be turned on via the
	  debug_level and mcast_debug_level module parameters (which
	  can also be set after the driver is loaded through sysfs).

	  This option also creates a directory tree under xve/ in
	  debugfs, which contains files that expose debugging
	  information about IB multicast groups used by the XVE
	  driver.

config INFINIBAND_XVE_DEBUG_DATA
	bool "Xsigo Virtual Ethernet data path debugging"
	depends on INFINIBAND_XVE_DEBUG
	---help---
	  This option compiles debugging code into the data path
	  of the XVE driver.  The output can be turned on via the
	  data_debug_level module parameter; however, even with output
	  turned off, this debugging code will have some performance
	  impact.
