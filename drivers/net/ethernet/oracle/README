Bug 17478097 - SOL NEM SXGE DRIVER NEEDS TO SUPPORT OVM AUTO-MIGRATION FOR 15 VMS
For live migration, we only can support up to 15 VMs due to the 
limitation of TCAM. If there are more than 15 VMs, user has to do it 
manually. Two options (Details can be found in the User's Guide):
. User chooses to use live migration, but each SOL NEM sxge port can 
only be used by up to 15 VMs per blade.
. User chooses to do it manually, then each SOL NEM sxge port can be 
used by up to 6k VMs per blade
