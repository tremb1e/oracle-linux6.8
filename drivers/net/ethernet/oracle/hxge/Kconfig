          This driver supports the Hydra 10Gb Ethernet driver.

        help
          NAPI is a new driver API designed to reduce CPU and interrupt load
          when the driver is receiving lots of packets from the card. It is
          still somewhat experimental and thus not yet enabled by default.

          If your estimated Rx load is 10kpps or more, or if the card will be
          deployed on potentially unfriendly networks (e.g. in a firewall),
          then say Y here.

          See <file:Documentation/networking/NAPI_HOWTO.txt> for more
          information.

          If in doubt, say N.
